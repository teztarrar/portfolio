## Automating IP Changes with Rust: The Story Behind autoIPChanger

As a System Administrator with an interest in privacy and network security, I often find myself looking for ways to improve online anonymity. That's where **autoIPChanger** comes in. Built in Rust, this tool leverages the Tor network to regularly change IP addresses, making it easier to maintain anonymity without manual intervention.

In this blog, I'll walk you through the motivation, setup, and use cases of **autoIPChanger** and why Rust was the language of choice for this project.

## The Inspiration for autoIPChanger

Working with Tor can be a powerful way to anonymize your network traffic, but frequent IP changes are essential to maximize this anonymity. Manual IP changes, however, are both tedious and time-consuming. With **autoIPChanger**, I aimed to automate this process, allowing Tor to change IP addresses at regular intervals without user intervention.

This project also provided a great opportunity to dive deeper into Rust, a language known for its speed and safety features, which are critical for system-level tasks.

## Features of autoIPChanger

autoIPChanger was designed with a few key features in mind:

1. **Automated Tor Setup**: Installs Tor on the system if not already present, ensuring ease of setup for all users.
2. **System-Wide Proxy Configuration**: Configures the system to route all traffic through Tor’s SOCKS5 proxy.
3. **Continuous IP Monitoring**: Automatically monitors and displays Tor’s circuit path, ensuring that IP changes are both visible and functional.

By integrating these features, autoIPChanger provides a seamless way to stay anonymous online without worrying about manual IP adjustments.

## Why Rust?

Rust is known for its high performance and memory safety, which are ideal for a tool like this, where efficiency and reliability are key. Using Rust also enabled me to handle low-level system configurations and network operations with confidence, knowing that Rust’s compiler would catch common mistakes that could lead to vulnerabilities.

## How to Use autoIPChanger

To try out autoIPChanger yourself, you can access the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/teztarrar/autoIPChanger). The setup is straightforward, and you can configure it to run on a regular schedule, enhancing your privacy with minimal effort.
