### **1. Image Capture**  
Cameras capture video footage through their lenses. Modern cameras use high-resolution sensors to produce detailed images.  

### **2. Data Transmission**  
The footage is transmitted either through wired connections (coaxial or Ethernet cables) or wirelessly using Wi-Fi.  

### **3. Storage**  
The data is stored on DVRs (for analog systems) or NVRs (for IP systems). Many systems also offer cloud storage for added reliability.  

### **4. Monitoring**  
Live feeds can be accessed on connected monitors or remotely via mobile apps or web interfaces.  

### **5. Recording and Playback**  
Recordings can be accessed for playback, making it easier to review incidents and extract evidence.
