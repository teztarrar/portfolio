## Introduction to networkRouting

In networking, finding the shortest and most efficient path between routers is essential for performance and connectivity. **networkRouting** is a command-line program built in C that enables users to validate IP addresses, analyze network connections, and calculate the shortest routing path between points in a network.

In this post, I’ll go over the inspiration and features of **networkRouting** and how it can be applied to simplify routing operations for system administrators and network enthusiasts alike.

## Why I Built networkRouting

As part of my journey in computer networking, I wanted to create a tool that could aid in efficient network routing and validation tasks. I developed **networkRouting** to provide a straightforward CLI-based solution for validating IP addresses, assessing connections, and finding optimized routing paths in a network, tasks that are critical in both education and real-world network management.

## Key Features of networkRouting

1. **IP Address Validation**: Ensures that all IP addresses in the network are valid and correctly formatted.
2. **Connection Analysis**: Identifies and verifies the connections between different routers to confirm proper network setup.
3. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Utilizes algorithms to find the most efficient route between routers, optimizing network traffic flow.

## The Choice of C for networkRouting

I chose C for this project due to its low-level networking capabilities and performance advantages, which are ideal for building efficient, lightweight tools for real-time network analysis.

## How to Use networkRouting

networkRouting is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/teztarrar/networkRouting), and you can find installation instructions, usage examples, and detailed documentation. It’s a great tool for anyone looking to simplify network management or gain deeper insights into network routing.
