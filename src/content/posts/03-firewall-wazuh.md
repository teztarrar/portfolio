## Introduction to firewall-wazuh

In today’s connected world, network security is paramount. **firewall-wazuh** is a Rust-based application designed to enforce stringent firewall policies, allowing only specific IPs and ports while blocking all other traffic. By leveraging `iptables` for packet filtering, **firewall-wazuh** provides a secure environment for network operations, making it ideal for administrators looking to protect sensitive networks.

## Motivation Behind firewall-wazuh

Having worked on various network administration projects, I wanted to build a tool that combines the precision of firewall control with automation. **firewall-wazuh** addresses this by allowing users to easily set up policies that restrict incoming and outgoing traffic based on strict IP and port rules, ensuring that only trusted sources can access the network.

## Key Features of firewall-wazuh

1. **IP Whitelisting**: Only allows traffic from specified IP addresses, blocking all others by default.
2. **Port Filtering**: Filters traffic based on specific ports, adding an additional layer of security.
3. **iptables Integration**: Utilizes `iptables` for managing packet filtering, making firewall policies both powerful and flexible.
4. **Rust-Powered Security**: The use of Rust ensures memory safety and performance, making firewall-wazuh fast and reliable.

## Why Rust and iptables?

Rust's memory safety and performance advantages make it an ideal choice for developing security-focused tools. Using `iptables` in combination with Rust allows **firewall-wazuh** to efficiently handle packet filtering, ensuring minimal impact on system resources while maintaining strong security controls.

## Getting Started with firewall-wazuh

The **firewall-wazuh** project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/teztarrar/firewall-wazuh), where you’ll find setup instructions and usage examples. The tool can be configured for various network environments, providing flexibility for different security needs.
