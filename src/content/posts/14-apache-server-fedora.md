# Apache (`httpd`) is a popular open-source web server. This guide explains how to manage it on Fedora.

---

## **Stopping the Apache (`httpd`) Service**

If you need to stop the `httpd` service, follow these simple steps:

### **Command to Stop Apache**
Run the following command in your terminal to stop the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop httpd
```

This command immediately halts the Apache HTTP server and ensures it is no longer running.

### **Verifying the Service is Stopped**

After stopping the service, it’s good practice to confirm its status. Use the following command to check:

```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

#### **Expected Output**
The output should look similar to this:

```yaml
● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; enabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: inactive (dead)
```

If the service is inactive (dead), it has been successfully stopped.

## **Disabling Apache from Starting on Boot**

To prevent Apache from starting automatically when your system boots up, use the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable httpd
```

### **Why Disable Apache on Boot?**

Disabling the service at boot is useful for:

- Development systems where Apache is not needed constantly.
- Minimizing resource usage on systems with limited resources.
- Preventing potential conflicts during startup.

## **Additional Apache Service Commands**

Here are some useful commands for managing the Apache service:

### **Restarting Apache**
To stop and immediately start the service again:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

### **Reloading Apache**
To reload the configuration without stopping the service (useful after updating configuration files):

```bash
sudo systemctl reload httpd
```

### **Enabling Apache to Start on Boot**
To ensure the service starts automatically during system boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

---

## **Common Troubleshooting Tips**

### **Check for Errors**
If the service fails to stop or start, check the logs for error messages:

```bash
sudo journalctl -xeu httpd
```

### **Ensure Proper Configuration**
Errors often occur due to misconfigurations in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` or virtual host files. Test your configuration with:

```bash
sudo apachectl configtest
```

### **Clear Service Cache**
In some cases, clearing the system manager's cache resolves unexpected behavior:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
```
